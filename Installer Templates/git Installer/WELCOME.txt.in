Welcome to the Git @GITVER@ Installation Program.

Git will be installed into /opt/git. Links for use on the command line will be provided in /usr/local/bin by default. If you prefer to not have these links installed, please choose to Customize your install.

OS X 10.4 is required, with 10.4.11 highly recommended. Binaries are built as Universal for both PowerPC and Intel. Installation on 10.5 and newer is untested, but hopefully works.

Installation on OS X 10.8 and newer is unsupported, due to Gatekeeper. If you try it, email with the results.

To uninstall this package, run the “Uninstall Git.command” provided on the disk image.

Changes from standard Git
-------------------------

This is a standard distribution without any source changes, plus
the additions below. The only way that this distribution functionally
differs is by creating symbolic links instead of hard links as the
packaging process does not maintain the hard links, plus the addition of some
useful, but optional, tools.

There may be changes in the future and they will be documented here.

Additions to this git
---------------------

* Items available from contrib/ which are in the path:
    - contacts (without the documentation)

    - credential/osxkeychain
    - diff-highlight
    - git-jump
    - subtree
    - workdir
* git-fat - Store binary files outside the repository, using rsync.
    - https://github.com/ozkandikmen-work/git-fat/tree/gunter-from-master

Notes
-----

* Unlike the Apple-provided distribution available with newer OS X versions,
  this distribution has a working ```gitk``` utility.
* HTML documentation is available in ```/opt/git/doc``` or at
  file:///opt/git/doc/index.html in your browser.
* Man page documentation is available in ```/opt/git/share/man```.

Known issues
------------

* Some perl modules do not work (so things like ```git-svn``` are broken).
  Most contrib items are not actually installed, but rather live in
  ```/opt/git/contrib``` (which makes things provided there harder to use).
* The binaries provided from contrib/ are not built as fat binaries yet.

Limitations
-----------

* No limitations are known which only affect this packaging of Git and which
  are not documented above.

For any additional issues in this build, please email lewellyn@geekbakery.net with details.
